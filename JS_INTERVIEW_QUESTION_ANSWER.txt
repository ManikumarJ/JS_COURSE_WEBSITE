Why were let and const introduced when var already existed?
let and const were introduced to avoid problems with var and to make variables safer and easier to control.

How does JavaScript decide the data type of a variable at runtime?
JavaScript decides the data type based on the value stored in the variable while the program is running.

What is the difference between == and ===, and why do companies prefer ===?
== checks only the value, but === checks both value and type, so companies prefer === to avoid mistakes.

How do logical operators (&&, ||) help in writing cleaner conditional code?
Logical operators reduce the need for long if statements and make conditions shorter and cleaner.

When would you choose switch over if-else in real applications?
switch is used when one value needs to be checked against many fixed options.

Why does the do-while loop execute at least once even if the condition is false?
The do-while loop runs once because the condition is checked only after the code runs.

What happens internally when a for loop runs in JavaScript?
A for loop starts a variable, checks the condition, runs the code, updates the variable, and repeats this until the condition is false.

How does array indexing work, and what happens if you access an index that does not exist?
Arrays use numbers starting from zero, and accessing a missing index gives undefined.

What is the difference between map() and forEach() in terms of return value and use case?
map() creates a new array, while forEach() is used to perform actions and does not return anything.

Why are higher-order array methods preferred over traditional loops?
They are easier to read, easier to write, and reduce errors.

How is an object stored in memory compared to a primitive value?
Primitive values store the actual data, but objects store a reference to the data.

What is the difference between iterating an object using for...in and Object.keys()?
for...in loops through all properties, while Object.keys() loops through only the object’s own properties.

What is the difference between parameters and arguments, and how do callbacks fit into this?
Parameters are names in a function, arguments are the values passed, and callbacks are functions passed to another function.

Why does asynchronous JavaScript not block the main thread, and how does this help the UI?
Async JavaScript runs slow tasks in the background so the screen does not freeze.

What is the role of the V8 engine in executing JavaScript and supporting React applications?
V8 runs JavaScript fast and helps React apps work smoothly.
